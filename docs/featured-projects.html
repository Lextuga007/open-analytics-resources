<p>This project aimed to improve understanding of how care pathways are performing and enable ‘what if’ analysis to identify more effective and efficient service configurations.</p>
<p>A versatile pathway tool was developed allows NHS analysts and managers to understand and model patient flow. PathSimR has supported many projects &amp; business cases within the CCG &amp; further afield. As well as improving the evidence base for decision making, the tool opened the eyes of clinicians &amp; managers to the benefits of advanced analytics.</p>

<p>This project aimed to realise the synergy between data analysts, managers and clinicians for identifying and acting on learning from patient safety data.</p>
<p>Analytical strategies in the child health directorate were developed and tested to inform the design of quality improvement projects led by paediatric trainees. The team developed a ‘how to’ guide, summarising the concepts, challenges and resources required to introduce the new analytical approach – allowing other organisations to adopt the approach, if successful.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.health.org.uk/improvement-projects/can-interactive-data-visualisation-help-clinicians-improve-patient-care">North East Quality Observatory Services: Can interactive data visualisation help clinicians improve patient care?</a></p>
<p>This project aimed to improve the way in which interactive data visualisation is used by clinicians so that it can lead to improvements in quality of care. It is not always clear how useful data visualisation tools are to clinicians or whether they can in fact lead to actionable outcomes. This project by NEQOS explored clinician requirements for engaging with these tools and explored whether more bespoke DV or other data interfaces may be more in line with clinician requirements. A literature review was conducted and an options appraisal undertaken before producing four interactive data visualisation dashboards: hip, knee, maternity and mortality monitoring. These were produced following extensive interaction with clinicians to establish their requirements as the end users.</p>

<p>NEQOS have shared all outputs and made them available <a href="https://www.neqos.nhs.uk/article_page/health-foundation-advancing-applied-analytics-project/">here</a>including a webinar, slideset and standard operating procedures. These design principles for data visualisation in a healthcare setting were also described in a publication <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/design-principles-for-data-visualisation-in-a-healthcare-setting-ef9bf2954a58">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.health.org.uk/improvement-projects/pathways-to-cancer-diagnosis-monitoring-variation-in-the-patient-journey-across">Health and Social Care N Ireland &amp; Business Services Organisation: Pathways to cancer diagnosis: Monitoring variation in the patient journey across Northern Ireland</a></p>
<p>This project was run by the Business Services Organisation Information Unit, with analytical support from Queen’s University Belfast. It aimed to improve understanding of the variation in routes-to-diagnosis (for example screen-detected, GP referral, emergency presentation) of cancer in Northern Ireland, in order to increase earlier diagnoses and treatment effectiveness. It produced estimates for routes-to-diagnosis at different health geographies down to GP practice level, and created an online tool for health service practitioners, informing national cancer strategy.</p>
